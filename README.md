# Go Learning Fun

This repository contains my progress through the official Go tutorials from [go.dev/learn](https://go.dev/learn/).

## About This Project

I'm working through the Go programming language tutorials to build a solid foundation in Go fundamentals and best practices. Each tutorial builds on previous concepts and introduces new features of the language.

## Tutorials Completed

- Getting Started
- Create a Module
- Create a database connection
- Developing a Web Service
- Using generic types
- Fuzzing (testing with random data)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.21+](https://go.dev/dl/) installed on your system

### Running the Code

To run any of the projects in this repository:

```bash
go run .
```

Or to build an executable:

```bash
go build
```

### Managing Dependencies

This project uses Go modules for dependency management. To download and verify dependencies:

```bash
go get .
```

Dependencies and their checksums are recorded in `go.sum` for reproducibility.
